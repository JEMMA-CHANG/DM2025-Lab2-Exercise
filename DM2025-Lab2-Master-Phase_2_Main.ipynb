      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "\n",

       "*   **Unlabeled Data:**\n",
       "    *   Customer A: Age 25, Spends $50/month, Buys electronics and clothing.\n",
       "    *   Customer B: Age 60, Spends $200/month, Buys home goods and books.\n",
       "    *   Customer C: Age 30, Spends $70/month, Buys electronics and gadgets.\n",
       "    *   Customer D: Age 55, Spends $180/month, Buys books and art supplies.\n",
       "    *   Customer E: Age 28, Spends $60/month, Buys clothing and accessories.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Goal:** To discover different types of customers you have, without knowing them in advance.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Process:** You feed this customer data into a clustering algorithm. The algorithm looks for customers who are similar to each other based on the features (age, spending, product preferences).\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Output (Clustering):** The clustering algorithm might identify groups like:\n",
       "    *   **Cluster 1 (Young Spenders):** Customers A and E, who are younger and spend moderately on fashion and electronics.\n",
       "    *   **Cluster 2 (Affluent Seniors):** Customers B and D, who are older and spend more on traditional items like books and home goods.\n",
       "    *   **Cluster 3 (Tech Enthusiasts):** Customer C, who is younger and heavily invested in electronics.\n",
       "\n",
       "    You then give these clusters meaningful names (e.g., \"Budget Shoppers,\" \"Luxury Buyers,\" \"Gadget Lovers\") and can use this understanding for targeted marketing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Other Examples of Clustering:**\n",
       "\n",

While both involve grouping data, their approaches and objectives are distinctly different. Pay close attention, as understanding this distinction is crucial for your future work.\n",

       "**What it is:**\n",
       "Classification is a **supervised learning** technique. This means we have a dataset where we already know the correct \"category\" or \"label\" for each data point. The goal of classification is to build a model that can predict the category of *new, unseen* data points based on the patterns learned from the labeled training data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Think of it like this:** You're teaching a child to identify different fruits. You show them an apple and say, \"This is an apple.\" You show them a banana and say, \"This is a banana.\" You provide many examples with their correct labels. Eventually, the child learns to identify a new apple they've never seen before as an \"apple.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
       "*   **Supervised:** Requires labeled training data.\n",
       "*   **Predictive:** Aims to predict a predefined category for new data.\n",
       "*   **Known Classes:** The categories (classes) are known beforehand.\n",
       "*   **Goal:** To assign new data points to one of the existing, known classes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Simple Example:**\n",
       "Imagine you have a dataset of emails, and each email is already labeled as either \"Spam\" or \"Not Spam.\"\n",

       "*   **New Data:** A brand new email arrives: \"Special discount on all electronics!\"\n",

       "**What it is:**\n",
       "Clustering is an **unsupervised learning** technique. This means we start with a dataset that has *no predefined labels* or categories. The goal of clustering is to discover inherent groupings or clusters within the data, where data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Think of it like this:** You give a child a box of assorted toys (cars, dolls, blocks) without telling them what they are.

      "diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n",
      "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",
      "discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n",
      "themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n",
      "This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n",
      "during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n",
      "uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n",

      "black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n",
      "planets. \n",
      "Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n",
      "opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n",
      "‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n",
      "feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n",
      "that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n",
      "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",
      "seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n",
      "At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n",
      "tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n",
      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",
      "wonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \n",
      "them to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \n",
      "bamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nThis isn’t my usual cup of tea but I decided to give it a chance because it was referenced in an \\nepisode of The Office. In fact, I think it was referenced in two episodes and that’s when my \\ncuriosity was piqued. I wasn’t expecting much, but I came away with a bundle of conflicting \\nthoughts in my head which I think is the mark of some sort of success. At the very least, I was \\nentertained. \\nThe first thing I want to say is that Emily Blunt completely stole the show here. Meryl Streep is \\ngoing to do Meryl Streep, and Anne Hathaway’s character is fairly straightforward, but I was \\nastonished at how convincingly Blunt was able to play bitchy, snarky and condescending, all \\nwhile saying thoroughly entertaining lines. Any scene she was in made me light up, and I was \\nsad when she basically disappeared in the final act. \\nNow, to the themes of this film. It dawned on me quickly that this wasn’t really a film about \\nfashion at all, but about being led into a cult. Having recently watched both Twin Flames \\ndocumentaries recently, I think I’m more prone to notice how a cult leader is able to indoctrinate \\nothers into following them. Anne Hathaway’s character Andrea doesn’t care about fashion at all - \\nmuch like myself, so she was easy to relate to - but she soon falls under Meryl Streep’s spell \\nafter she is constantly negged by her boss and treated as worthless by all her colleagues. \\nStreep’s character, Miranda Priestly, can’t even be bothered to learn Andrea’s name - or \\npurposefully calls her by a different name to make her feel worthless. In an early scene, we see \\nAndrea speak up for herself and correct Miranda, which results in Miranda’s wrath. After being \\nmade to do all sorts of humiliating and challenging chores for Miranda, the two have an argument \\nwhere it seems as if Andrea will be fired. The assertive part of myself was willing for her to stand \\nup for herself and ask that she be treated decently since that’s what she deserves. Instead, she \\nruns off and cries to Stanley Tucci’s character, who gaslights her and says she isn’t trying hard \\nenough. I get it; when I began working in an office, the amount of social pressure I felt made it \\nvery difficult for me to ask for more equitable circumstances. Tucci influences her to start wearing \\nmore fashionable clothes, which she seems to adjust to instantly. \\nI also want to take a moment here and talk about something I loathe in films like these, where \\nAnne Hathaway’s character is described as fat and ugly by the characters around her. \\nAdmittedly, these are the characters that are gaslighting her into part of their cult, but all the \\nsame it’s utterly insane to try and cast someone like Anne Hathaway to play some sort of plain \\nJane. She’s freaking Anne Hathaway. Just look at her. She could look great wearing a plastic \\nrubbish bag or a tarpaulin. It’s crazy that they do the ‘ugly duckling to beautiful swan’ \\ntransformation on her in this film. I also think that she seems to adjust too quickly. If it were me, I \\nguess I would try some clothes, but I would never be able to keep it up. \\nInterestingly, her hipster boyfriend uses the term “you drank the Kool-Aid,” because that was \\nexactly what was floating around my head at that time. She’s in a cult where everyone is \\nobsessed with Miranda, and that’s really what I think this film is about. \\nThen there’s the disgusting Christian Thompson character, whose ulterior motives are so clear \\nthat they don’t seem ulterior at all. Why on earth would this successful businessman be suddenly \\ninterested in an assistant for anything other than wanting to sleep with her or get closer to \\nMiranda? He feigns interest in her writing, but she naively believes it. It was really galling to \\nwatch her be this naive, but I suppose it’s good if a film can make you feel that way. \\nI was quite enjoying the ride of seeing Andrea getting sucked more and more into the cult, losing \\nher friends and her boyfriend along the way, and was interested in the outcome. However, the\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nending was bitterly disappointing. All it takes is a few words from Miranda for Andrea to suddenly \\nrealise “I don’t want to be like you” and then walk away, throw her work phone in a Parisian \\nfountain and suffer absolutely no consequences. It is monumentally difficult to extract yourself \\nfrom a cult, to have to unplug yourself from that mindset, and it is emotionally challenging to \\nreckon with the damage that cult has done to your psyche. Andrea seems to snap straight back \\nto her old self, but who knows if there’s any lasting damage? Her boyfriend takes her back, \\nMiranda recommends her for a job and then even gives one of her coveted ‘rare smiles’ to close \\nthe film. Utter hogwash, and it suggests that it’s a good thing that Miranda gave her the smile that \\neveryone in the fashion industry clamours for. I don’t think the film quite acknowledges just how \\nharmful Miranda’s character is and doesn’t punish her enough at the end to make this a ‘happy \\nending’. \\nOn the one hand, it presents a rather accurate portrayal of how a cult can be, with a charismatic \\ncult leader who can be ruthless to their subjects and with other members participating in the \\nbrainwashing. On the other hand, the film misses some beats, especially near the end that would \\nhave made this tale more realistic and satisfying. At the very least, Emily Blunt’s character made \\nme laugh a ton. My favourite moment was when she uttered “What a pile of bollocks!” between \\nmouthfuls of chocolate pudding in the hospital.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "\n",
    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">For the exercise in this section there is no need to re-run the cells, you can use the data that has been saved previously to the corresponding directory.</span>\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
