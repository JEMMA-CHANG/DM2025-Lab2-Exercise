&quot;&quot;&quot;
This isn’t my usual cup of tea but I decided to give it a chance because it was referenced in an 
episode of The Office. In fact, I think it was referenced in two episodes and that’s when my 
curiosity was piqued. I wasn’t expecting much, but I came away with a bundle of conflicting 
thoughts in my head which I think is the mark of some sort of success. At the very least, I was 
entertained. 
The first thing I want to say is that <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Emily Blunt completely stole the show here</span>. Meryl Streep is 
going to do Meryl Streep, and Anne Hathaway’s character is fairly straightforward, but I was 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">astonished at how convincingly Blunt was able to play bitchy, snarky and condescending</span>, all 
while saying <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">thoroughly entertaining lines</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Any scene she was in made me light up</span>, and I was 
sad when she basically disappeared in the final act. 
Now, to the themes of this film. It dawned on me quickly that this wasn’t really a film about 
fashion at all, but about being led into a cult. Having recently watched both Twin Flames 
documentaries recently, I think I’m more prone to notice how a cult leader is able to indoctrinate 
others into following them. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Anne Hathaway’s character Andrea doesn’t care about fashion at all - 
much like myself, so she was easy to relate to</span> - but she soon falls under Meryl Streep’s spell 
after she is constantly negged by her boss and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">treated as worthless by all her colleagues</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Streep’s character, Miranda Priestly, can’t even be bothered to learn Andrea’s name - or 
purposefully calls her by a different name to make her feel worthless</span>. In an early scene, we see 
Andrea speak up for herself and correct Miranda, which results in Miranda’s wrath. After being 
made to do all sorts of humiliating and challenging chores for Miranda, the two have an argument 
where it seems as if Andrea will be fired. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">The assertive part of myself was willing for her to stand 
up for herself and ask that she be treated decently since that’s what she deserves.</span> Instead, she 
runs off and cries to Stanley Tucci’s character, who gaslights her and says she isn’t trying hard 
enough. I get it; when I began working in an office, the amount of social pressure I felt made it 
very difficult for me to ask for more equitable circumstances. Tucci influences her to start wearing 
more fashionable clothes, which she seems to adjust to instantly. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I also want to take a moment here and talk about something I loathe in films like these, where 
Anne Hathaway’s character is described as fat and ugly by the characters around her.</span> 
Admittedly, these are the characters that are gaslighting her into part of their cult, but all the 
same <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it’s utterly insane to try and cast someone like Anne Hathaway to play some sort of plain 
Jane.</span> She’s freaking Anne Hathaway. Just look at her. She could look great wearing a plastic 
rubbish bag or a tarpaulin. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s crazy that they do the ‘ugly duckling to beautiful swan’ 
transformation on her in this film.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I also think that she seems to adjust too quickly. If it were me, I 
guess I would try some clothes, but I would never be able to keep it up.</span> 
Interestingly, her hipster boyfriend uses the term “you drank the Kool-Aid,” <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">because that was 
exactly what was floating around my head at that time.</span> She’s in a cult where everyone is 
obsessed with Miranda, and that’s really what I think this film is about. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Then there’s the disgusting Christian Thompson character, whose ulterior motives are so clear 
that they don’t seem ulterior at all.</span> Why on earth would this successful businessman be suddenly 
interested in an assistant for anything other than wanting to sleep with her or get closer to 
Miranda? He feigns interest in her writing, but she naively believes it. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It was really galling to 
watch her be this naive, but I suppose <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it’s good if a film can make you feel that way.</span></span> 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I was quite enjoying the ride of seeing Andrea getting sucked more and more into the cult, losing 
her friends and her boyfriend along the way</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">was interested in the outcome</span>. However, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
ending was bitterly disappointing. All it takes is a few words from Miranda for Andrea to suddenly 
realise “I don’t want to be like you” and then walk away, throw her work phone in a Parisian 
fountain and suffer absolutely no consequences. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It is monumentally difficult to extract yourself 
from a cult, to have to unplug yourself from that mindset, and it is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">emotionally challenging to 
reckon with the damage that cult has done to your psyche</span></span>. Andrea seems to snap straight back 
to her old self, but who knows if there’s any lasting damage? Her boyfriend takes her back, 
Miranda recommends her for a job and then even gives one of her coveted ‘rare smiles’ to close 
the film. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Utter hogwash</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it suggests that it’s a good thing that Miranda gave her the smile that 
everyone in the fashion industry clamours for</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I don’t think the film quite acknowledges just how 
harmful Miranda’s character is and doesn’t punish her enough at the end to make this a ‘happy 
ending</span>’. 
On the one hand, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it presents a rather accurate portrayal of how a cult can be, with a charismatic 
cult leader who can be ruthless to their subjects and with other members participating in the 
brainwashing</span>. On the other hand, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the film misses some beats, especially near the end that would 
have made this tale more realistic and satisfying</span>. At the very least, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Emily Blunt’s character <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">made 
me laugh a ton</span></span>. My favourite moment was when she uttered “What a pile of bollocks!” between 
mouthfuls of chocolate pudding in the hospital.
