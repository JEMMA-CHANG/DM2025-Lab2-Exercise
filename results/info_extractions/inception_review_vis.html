This isn’t my usual cup of tea but I decided to give it a chance because it was referenced in an 
episode of The Office. In fact, I think it was referenced in two episodes and that’s when my 
curiosity was piqued. I wasn’t expecting much, but I came away with a bundle of conflicting 
thoughts in my head which I think is the mark of some sort of success. At the very least, I was 
entertained. 
The first thing I want to say is that <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Emily Blunt completely stole the show here</span>. Meryl Streep is 
going to do Meryl Streep, and Anne Hathaway’s character is fairly straightforward, but I was 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">astonished at how convincingly Blunt was able to play bitchy, snarky and condescending</span>, all 
while saying <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">thoroughly entertaining lines</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Any scene she was in made me light up</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I was 
sad when she basically disappeared in the final act</span>. 
Now, to the themes of this film. It dawned on me quickly that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this wasn’t really a film about 
fashion at all, but about being led into a cult</span>. Having recently watched both Twin Flames 
documentaries recently, I think I’m more prone to notice how a cult leader is able to indoctrinate 
others into following them. Anne Hathaway’s character Andrea doesn’t care about fashion at all - 
much like myself, so <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she was easy to relate to</span> - but she soon <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">falls under Meryl Streep’s spell</span> 
after she is constantly negged by her boss and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">treated as worthless</span> by all her colleagues. 
Streep’s character, Miranda Priestly, can’t even be bothered to learn Andrea’s name - or 
purposefully calls her by a different name to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">make her feel worthless</span>. In an early scene, we see 
Andrea speak up for herself and correct Miranda, which results in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Miranda’s wrath</span>. After being 
made to do all sorts of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">humiliating and challenging chores</span> for Miranda, the two have an argument 
where it seems as if Andrea will be fired. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">The assertive part of myself was willing for her to stand 
up for herself and ask that she be treated decently</span> since <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">that’s what she deserves</span>. Instead, she 
runs off and cries to Stanley Tucci’s character, who <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">gaslights her and says she isn’t trying hard 
enough</span>. I get it; when I began working in an office, the amount of social pressure I felt <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">made it 
very difficult for me to ask for more equitable circumstances</span>. Tucci influences her to start wearing 
more fashionable clothes, which she seems to adjust to instantly. 
I also want to take a moment here and talk about <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">something I loathe in films like these, where 
Anne Hathaway’s character is described as fat and ugly by the characters around her</span>. 
Admittedly, these are the characters that are gaslighting her into part of their cult, but all the 
same <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it’s utterly insane to try and cast someone like Anne Hathaway to play some sort of plain 
Jane</span>. She’s freaking Anne Hathaway. Just look at her. She could look great wearing a plastic 
rubbish bag or a tarpaulin. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s crazy that they do the ‘ugly duckling to beautiful swan’ 
transformation on her in this film</span>. I also think that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she seems to adjust too quickly</span>. If it were me, I 
guess I would try some clothes, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I would never be able to keep it up</span>. 
Interestingly, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">her hipster boyfriend uses the term “you drank the Kool-Aid,” because that was 
exactly what was floating around my head at that time</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">She’s in a cult where everyone is 
obsessed with Miranda, and that’s really what I think this film is about</span>. 
Then there’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the disgusting Christian Thompson character, whose ulterior motives are so clear 
that they don’t seem ulterior at all</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Why on earth would this successful businessman be suddenly 
interested in an assistant for anything other than wanting to sleep with her or get closer to 
Miranda?</span> He feigns interest in her writing, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she naively believes it</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It was really galling to 
watch her be this naive</span>, but I suppose it’s good if a film can <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">make you feel that way</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I was quite enjoying the ride</span> of seeing Andrea getting sucked more and more into the cult, losing 
her friends and her boyfriend along the way, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">was interested in the outcome</span>. However, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
ending was bitterly disappointing. All it takes is a few words from Miranda for Andrea to suddenly 
realise “I don’t want to be like you” and then walk away, throw her work phone in a Parisian 
fountain and suffer absolutely no consequences. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It is monumentally difficult to extract yourself 
from a cult</span>, to have to unplug yourself from that mindset, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it is emotionally challenging to 
reckon with the damage that cult has done to your psyche</span>. Andrea seems to snap straight back 
to her old self, but who knows if there’s any lasting damage? Her boyfriend takes her back, 
Miranda recommends her for a job and then even gives one of her coveted ‘rare smiles’ to close 
the film. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Utter hogwash</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it suggests that it’s a good thing that Miranda gave her the smile that 
everyone in the fashion industry clamours for</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I don’t think the film quite acknowledges just how 
harmful Miranda’s character is</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">doesn’t punish her enough at the end to make this a ‘happy 
ending</span>’. 
On the one hand, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it presents a rather accurate portrayal of how a cult can be</span>, with a charismatic 
cult leader who can be ruthless to their subjects and with other members participating in the 
brainwashing. On the other hand, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the film misses some beats, especially near the end that would 
have made this tale more realistic and satisfying</span>. At the very least, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Emily Blunt’s character made 
me laugh a ton</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">My favourite moment was when she uttered “What a pile of bollocks!” between 
mouthfuls of chocolate pudding in the hospital</span>.
